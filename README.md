This Repo holds a Convolutional Fully Connected Neural Net created by the author. It is a built from scracth implementation in java, using no libraries, including matrix algebra done by hand! More of a pet project to practice the mathematics and concepts behind backpropagation and neural nets. 

Current implementation is in simple one hots, and mnist dataset.
